# Photonic Sustainability Loop

## Concept

A closed-loop system that captures environmental data via photonic sensors, feeds it into quantum optimizers (managed by TDIS), and then adjusts operational parameters in real-time to minimize environmental impact and maximize efficiency.

## Energy Optimization Equation (Conceptual)

The efficiency gain or energy optimization (Î”E) can be conceptualized as a function of photon energy, qubit coherence, and computational photonic efficiency:
$$
\Delta E \propto \hbar \omega \cdot \tau_{coherence} \cdot CPM
$$

Where:
- $\hbar \omega$: Photon energy
- $\tau_{coherence}$: Qubit coherence time (s)
- CPM: Computational Photonic Mile (a metric for energy cost per computational work over photonic links)

## Implementation Notes

- Photonic sensors (e.g., LIDAR on QEPs) operate at specific wavelengths (e.g., 532 nm dual-polarization).
- Data is ingested by TDIS (target: v2.3 API) with low latency (target: <1 ms).
- Quantum optimizer utilizes solvers (e.g., QUBO) to minimize emissions footprint or optimize routes.

## About GAIA-QAO

GAIA-QAO is an organizational structure inspired by the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, applied to the management and development of aerospace projects. The goal is to create a dynamic and adaptable model that allows the various components of the organization to operate in multiple functional states simultaneously, thus optimizing responsiveness and efficiency in response to specific operational contexts.
