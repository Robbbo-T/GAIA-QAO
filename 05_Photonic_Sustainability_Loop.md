# Photonic Sustainability Loop

## Concept

A closed-loop system that captures environmental data via photonic sensors, feeds it into quantum optimizers (managed by TDIS), and then adjusts operational parameters in real-time to minimize environmental impact and maximize efficiency.

## Energy Optimization Equation (Conceptual)

The efficiency gain or energy optimization (Î”E) can be conceptualized as a function of photon energy, qubit coherence, and computational photonic efficiency:
$$
\Delta E \propto \hbar \omega \cdot \tau_{coherence} \cdot CPM
$$

Where:
- $\hbar \omega$: Photon energy
- $\tau_{coherence}$: Qubit coherence time (s)
- CPM: Computational Photonic Mile (a metric for energy cost per computational work over photonic links)

## Implementation Notes

- Photonic sensors (e.g., LIDAR on QEPs) operate at specific wavelengths (e.g., 532 nm dual-polarization).
- Data is ingested by TDIS (target: v2.3 API) with low latency (target: <1 ms).
- Quantum optimizer utilizes solvers (e.g., QUBO) to minimize emissions footprint or optimize routes.
