# QEP Optical Design

## Objective

Define the optical throughput $F_{sensor}$ for the Quantum Environmental Probe (QEP) to ensure high-fidelity data capture.

## Sensor Throughput (Conceptual Formula)

The sensor's light gathering and conversion efficiency can be represented as:
$$
F_{sensor} = A \cdot \Omega \cdot \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2} T(\lambda) \cdot QE(\lambda) d\lambda
$$

Where:
- $A$: Aperture Area
- $\Omega$: Solid Angle of View
- $T(\lambda)$: Optical Transmission efficiency at wavelength $\lambda$
- $QE(\lambda)$: Quantum Efficiency of the detector at wavelength $\lambda$
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$: Operational wavelength range (e.g., 400–700 nm)

## Target Technical Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Wavelength Range | 400–700 nm |
| Quantum Efficiency (peak) | ≥ 85 % |
| Aperture Diameter | 10 cm |
| Detector Noise | < 5 e¯ RMS |
| Sampling Rate | 1 kHz |

## About GAIA-QAO

GAIA-QAO is an organizational structure inspired by the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, applied to the management and development of aerospace projects. The goal is to create a dynamic and adaptable model that allows the various components of the organization to operate in multiple functional states simultaneously, thus optimizing responsiveness and efficiency in response to specific operational contexts.
